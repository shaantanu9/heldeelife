## 2. Marketing Channels (Selected with Rationale)

| Channel | Rationale | Primary Use |
|---------|------------|-------------|

| **Content / SEO** | Long-term acquisition; target audience researches “Ayurveda”, “natural”, condition terms; blog and insights already in product. | Blog, insights, category/product SEO, how-to and condition-focused content. |
| **Social (Meta, Instagram, YouTube)** | Health-conscious and clean-beauty segments are mobile-heavy and influenced by reviews and visuals; India + diaspora active on these. | Brand stories, UGC, testimonials, short-form video, reels, ads (retargeting, lookalike). |
| **Paid search (Google)** | Intent-led; capture “Ayurveda”, “natural supplements”, “clean beauty” and product-level queries. | Brand + category + product keywords; shopping ads where applicable. |
| **PR / partnerships** | Build authority and trust; align with practitioners, wellness influencers, and “authentic Ayurveda” narrative. | Expert quotes, collaborations, featured content, export/NA-EU credibility. |

**Channels deprioritised for initial phase:** Podcasts, affiliate at scale, TikTok (can test later for Gen Z clean-beauty).
