## 3. Style Guide: Tone, Voice, and Brand Guidelines

### Master narrative
**“Authentic Ayurveda, modern care.”** — Every piece should feel rooted in tradition, clear on quality, and effortless to use (modern, mobile-first).

### Tone
- **Warm and knowledgeable:** Expert but approachable; no jargon without a one-line explainer.
- **Trust-first:** Lead with authenticity, certifications (GMP), and guarantees; avoid hype or empty claims.
- **Active voice:** Short sentences; 3–5 sentence paragraphs max for web.
- **Inclusive:** “You” and “your wellness”; avoid “consumers” or “users.”

### Voice attributes
| Attribute | Do | Avoid |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| **Authentic** | Real ingredients, origins, usage; cite tradition where relevant | Vague “natural,” unsubstantiated “ancient secret” |
| **Clear** | Benefits in plain language; dosage and usage explicit | Overly technical or flowery without substance |
| **Caring** | Support your body, take your time, we’re here | Pushy, guilt-based, fear-based |
| **Modern** | Fast delivery, easy returns, secure checkout, mobile-friendly | Old-fashioned or stuffy |

### Formatting
- **Headings:** H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections; scannable.
- **Lists:** Bullets for 3+ items; numbers for steps or sequences.
- **CTAs:** One primary CTA per section; action-oriented (“Shop by concern,” “Start with bestsellers,” “Subscribe for offers”).
- **Trust line (footer/emails):** “100% Authentic | GMP | Easy returns | Secure checkout | Free shipping above ₹X.”

### By channel
- **Blog/Insights:** SEO-friendly titles and meta; internal links to categories/products; CTA at end (Read more, Shop this, Subscribe).
- **Email:** Subject lines under 50 chars where possible; one main CTA per email; mobile-first; plain-text option for transactional.
- **Social:** Platform-native (hashtags for IG/Meta; hooks for YouTube); visuals with minimal text overlay; CTA in caption or first comment.
- **Landing pages:** Headline = value prop; subhead = proof or segment message; single primary CTA; trust badges above fold.

### Segment adaptation
- **Health-conscious:** “Natural wellness you can trust.” — Simple benefits, bestsellers, shop by concern.
- **Ayurveda seekers:** “Rooted in tradition, backed by quality.” — Ingredients, origins, blog, guides.
- **Clean beauty:** “Clean beauty that works.” — Reviews, before/after, community.
- **Chronic/preventive:** “Support your body the natural way.” — Subscribe & save, reminders, learn more.
- **International:** “Authentic Ayurveda, delivered.” — Certifications, shipping, guarantees.
